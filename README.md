## Installation

The user will first be required to have a command-line application downloaded onto their computer or laptop. If the user has this downloaded, the user could type "npm i" into their terminal or window. This should install the dependencies (such as babel, express, webpack, workbox, and more) into the user's command-line application. Once these packages are finished being installed, the user can type in "npm run start" to start the server. 

## Usage

Once the user has downloaded all the dependencies and starts the server, the user will be shown a single-page application. The user could input in any texts or code snippets. There will be an install button at the top that the user could click on in order to install their text.
